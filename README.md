# Twitter Like/Follow Scripts
Very simple scripts to automate likes and following users on twitter. 

## Warning
Do not use these scripts for long periods of time. Twitter will reconize them and block your account. 
Recomended to use no more then 10 minutes at a time. 

## Directions
Make sure you have google chrome and that you have enabled scripts in the console. 

### Likes
Go to a page with tweets you want to like. Copy and paste the like script into Chrome console and press return. The script will like each post on the page, then scroll down and like the next page of posts. Simple as that. Make sure to close the window after 5-10 minutes as the script will not stop otherwise and your account will get flagged or banned. 

### Follows
Go to a page with users you want to follow. Copy and paste the follow script into Chrome console and press return. The script will follow each user on the page, then scroll down and follow the next page of users. Simple as that. Make sure to close the window after 5-10 minutes as the script will not stop otherwise and your account will get flagged or banned. 

### Unfollows
Go to your page under people you follow. Copy and paste the follow script into Chrome console and press return. The script will unfollow each user on the page, then scroll down and unfollow the next page of users. Simple as that. Make sure to close the window after 5-10 minutes as the script will not stop otherwise and your account will get flagged or banned.
